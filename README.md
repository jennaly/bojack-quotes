## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** MongoDB, Express.js, EJS, Node.js, JS, CSS

Express and Node are installed to efficiently create a server. Nodemon is installed for ease of development. A database is set up with Mongo Atlas and is connected via MongoClient. Routes and corresponding controller functions are set up for basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. EJS is used as the templating engine to render data retrieved from the database to the client.

## Optimizations

I would create a Model component to the project, where Schemas are set up to define the structure and content of the data (quotes and authors) in the database. 

## Lessons Learned:

Through this project I was able to practice connecting to an external database, updating its contents, and modifying the DOM to reflect changes in said database.
